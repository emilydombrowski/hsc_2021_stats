# hsc_2021_stats: Temperature Tolerance and Physiology of the Horseshoe Crab, Limulus polyphemus

Objective: This project aims to give preliminary data about horseshoe crab (HSC) hemolymph differs based on temperature variation and relative horseshoe crab age and conduct power analyses to see parameters needed for future studies.

Folders
* data: contains .csv files with relevant data for project
* scripts: contains .Rmd file used to generate graphs and code
* figs: contains .html output for project figures

Project repository for data collected about HSC hemolymph physiology. This project was a pilot study conducted over a 10 week period in 2021. The questions this study sought to assess are: 
* Does temperature affect HSC physiology and hemolymph?
* Does age affect HSC physiology and hemolymph?

The structure for this code base is R. All data can be found under the data folder in the form of two documents. Files are stored in the .csv format. Data files contain information about HSC tag information, age, temperature acclimation, amebocyte density, amebocyte morphology, and heart rate. 

My results are in the form of box plots, linear models, and power analyses.
