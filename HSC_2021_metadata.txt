DATA & FILE OVERVIEW


1. File List: 
<list all files (or folders, as appropriate for dataset organization) contained in the dataset, with a brief description>


2. Relationship between files, if important: 
Data folder contains HSC_morph_hr and HSC_ameb_dens. Both files refer to the same set of 17 HSCs, but different study parameters


3. Additional related data collected that was not included in the current data package: NA


4. Are there multiple versions of the dataset? No


DATA-SPECIFIC INFORMATION FOR: HSC_age_dens


1. Number of variables: 8


2. Number of cases/rows: 17


3. Variable List: 
id -> horseshoe crab ID as provided by the South Carolina Department of Natural resources for tagging. 
sex -> listed as M or F to correspond with male or female
age -> listed as O or Y to correspond with old or young; aging procedure detailed by Sasson, Johnson, and Brockmann (2012)
temp -> HSC were experimentally acclimated to 20°C and 30°C, which corresponds to 20 and 30
tank -> HSC were held in 5 tanks throughout the experiment, 1-5 denotes which tank
hc_280 -> refers to hemocyanin concentration read at 280 nm in mg/mL; procedure adopted from Coates et al. (2011)
hc_350 -> refers to hemocyanin concentration read at 350 nm in mg/mL; procedure adopted from Coates et al. (2011)
ameb_d -> refers to amebocyte density in cells/mL; counting and procedure evaluated by Hurton et al. (2005)


DATA-SPECIFIC INFORMATION FOR: HSC_morph_hr


1. Number of variables: 9


2. Number of cases/rows: 51


3. Variable List: 
id -> horseshoe crab ID as provided by the South Carolina Department of Natural resources for tagging. 
tank -> HSC were held in 5 tanks throughout the experiment, 1-5 denotes which tank
sex -> listed as M or F to correspond with male or female
age -> listed as O or Y to correspond with old or young; aging procedure detailed by Sasson, Johnson, and Brockmann (2012)
temp -> HSC were experimentally acclimated to 20°C and 30°C, which corresponds to 20 and 30
morph_p -> refers to the percent present of different amebocyte morphologies as observed on hemocytometer; procedure adopted from Coates et al. (2011)
morph_c -> denotes 3 amebocyte morphologies: Contracted (C), Granular Flattened (GF), and Degranular Flattened (DGF)
hr -> indicates beats per minute of HSC heart rate as taken by an infrared heart rate monitor 
hr_c -> indicates heart rate condition: pre, post, and post2. Pre refers to HSC heart rate 5 minutes before blood draw, post refers to HSC heart rate 5 minutes after blood draw, and post2 refers to heart rate from 5-10 minutes after blood draw
